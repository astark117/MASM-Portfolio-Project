# MASM-Portfolio-Project
Assembly portfolio project featuring the applications of string primitives and macros

This program will accept 10 integer inputs as strings from the user. These inputs are then converted to SDWORD values and validated. Errors are raised if the string inputs contain non-integer characters or are too large to fit in a SDWORD data type. After 10 valid entries, the values entered will be displayed. Following that the sum and average of the values will be calculated and displayed. All integers displayed are converted back from SDWORD to character arrays and displayed as strings.
